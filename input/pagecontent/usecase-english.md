* Patient: Mrs. S. Ufferer who lives in an elderly home. She felt after leaving the bed.

Dr. O. Rderplacer ordered a ct scan of the hip. The images show an impression fracture of the right thighbone. According to the radiology report, the impression fracture seems to be stable. Taking into account the age of the patient, a surgical intervention does not seem to be necessary. However, Dr. O. Rderplacer is not shure, if this decision is right and he sends images and report to a orthopedic surgean for a second oppinion.

<i>The second opinion as described above has to be distinguished from real-time remote reporting and case presentation such as provided by various teleradiology solutions. The latter requires however a technical infrastructure which is beyond what is necessary for direc-tional communication such as discussed here. <i>
